# Guitreasure Hunt

In this project, I built a note finding app to learn the notes on a guitar neck. 
The app randomly chooses a note and the user has to find all occurrences on the 
virtual guitar neck.

This app is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Further similar app ideas
- The app will show all notes in a particular chord, so that users can design their own chord shapes.
- The app will show a (major) key and the user has to enter all notes in this key.

## Bug fixes
- Implement refresh button
- If all notes were found, fretboard should refresh
- Nice to have: Counter of which note was practiced how much
