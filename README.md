# Guitreasure Hunt

In this project, I built a note finding app to learn the notes on a guitar neck. 
The app randomly chooses a note and the user has to find all occurrences on the 
virtual guitar neck.

This app is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Features
- Visual guitar fretboard created only with CSS.
- The fretboard was created dynamically. This way, the app can be extended for other string-like instruments (e.g. ukulele).
- Statistics show how many wrong and correct answers the user had (in the current round) + how many notes s/he has revised.
- After finding all occurrences of a note (n = 6), the app suggests a new random note.

## Planned features
- The app will show all notes in a particular chord, so that users can design their own chord shapes.
- The app will show a (major) key and the user has to enter all notes in this key.
